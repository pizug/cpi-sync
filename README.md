# CPI Sync (cpisync.exe)

CPI Sync is a command line tool that lets you download and extract SAP CPI packages & artifacts to your local directories.

It has two main configurations that are documented below:

- Command line arguments
- Config file in JSON format

## Quick Start Guide

1. Download it from GitHub releases.
2. Create an empty directory, and put `cpisync.exe` inside the directory
3. Just copy the example config below, change the fields. Using the JSON create `cpi-sync.json` file inside the same directory.
4. You can double-click on `cpisync.exe` and it will ask for the password while running.
   1. Alternative: You can start `cmd` or PowerShell, set the environment variable `CPI_PASSWORD` and then `cpisync`
      1. For Windows cmd.exe: `set CPI_PASSWORD=yourpass`
      2. For Windows Powershell: `` $env:CPI_PASSWORD="your`$pass" `` (You can escape special characters with backtick "`" character)
      3. For Linux: `export CPI_PASSWORD=yourpass`
   2. Alternative: See "Recommended Credentials: OAuth"

### Example Config

```json
{
  "cpisync": "0.2.0",

  "tenant": {
    "management_host": "change-tmn.hci.eu1change.hana.ondemand.com",
    "credential": {
      "s_user": {
        "username": "S000change",
        "password_environment_variable": "CPI_PASSWORD"
      }
    }
  },
  "packages": {
    "local_dir": "relative/path/to/config",
    "filter_rules": [
      { "type": "single", "id": "TrainingPackage" },
      { "type": "single", "id": "eDocumentElectronicInvoicingforYou" },
      { "type": "single", "id": "MYPACKAGE" },
      { "type": "regex", "pattern": ".*", "operation": "include" },
      { "type": "regex", "pattern": "Test.*", "operation": "exclude" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## No clear-text password please!

You may notice there is no field called `password` and the tool will give error if it encounters one. That is a feature to prevent clear-text passwords. Current options are interactive or environment variable.

This feature makes the tool harder to use, but I think it worths the effort. And we can find both secure & more convenient solutions in the future.

## CI/CD usage

There are two ideas here:

- You can pass credential secrets via environment variables
- Use command argument `--no-input`

## Recommended Credentials: OAuth

OAuth is recommended. If you are on Cloud Foundry, you can create Service Keys as explained in [this blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/13/using-cloud-integration-apis-with-tools-on-cloud-foundry-creating-a-service-key/).

Create an OAuth client for your tenant. Use `oauth_client_credentials` object under `credential` for the configuration.

### Example Config Part for OAuth

```json
{
  "credential": {
    "oauth_client_credentials": {
      "client_id": "CPISyncAuthClientAPI",
      "client_secret_environment_variable": "CPI_PASSWORD",
      "token_endpoint_url": "https://oauthasservices-000change000.hana.ondemand.com/oauth2/api/v1/token"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using with Git

`prop_comment_removal` option can be useful to have a clear Git history. `parameters.prop` files contain automatically generated timestamps in a comment, even if no development made for the flow.

```json
{
  "packages": {
    "prop_comment_removal": "enabled"
  }
}
```

## Updates

When you download a new version of the tool. Schema version will be updated and you may need to change version like `"cpisync": "0.2.0"` , preferably after checking the documentation!

There may be occasional breaking changes on the format, advice & feedback from the community will play a big role.

### JSON Config File Reference

| Options for Packages Object | Default  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| zip_extraction              | enabled  | Extract artifact contents, this is useful for Git usage. If you prefer to keep artifacts as .zip files for backup, disable this option.                                                                             |
| local_dir                   | "./"     | Directory to download artifacts, it can be relative to the config file or absolute path. By default it is the same directory that contains config file. Regular rules apply for Linux/Windows paths and JSON escape |
| prop_comment_removal        | disabled | Removes auto-generated timestamp comments in `parameters.prop`. Useful for keeping Git history clean. Only works when zip_extraction is enabled. It is disabled by default since it changes content.                |
| filter_rules                | -        | Filter rules to select packages for sync. It can contain simple package id or regex rules. Defaults to no package download.                                                                                         |
| download_worker_count       | 5        | Concurrent handling of download per package content and per artifact download. It defaults to 5 workers.                                                                                                            |

Config file version can be older than tool version(Currently `0.2.0`), this is to prevent unnecessary changes if there are no breaking changes to the config structure.

You can inspect `config.schema.json` under `resources`. You can use a tool like ["JSON Schema Faker"](https://json-schema-faker.js.org/) to get more ideas about your options. Just paste the schema and click generate a few times!

You can also use ["JSON Schema Validator draft-07"](https://jsonschemalint.com/#!/version/draft-07/markup/json) if you get too many errors on your config file.
